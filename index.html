          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img  title="This picture was taken while I was on a Wolf watching expedition in Yellowstone National Park" src="assets/images/bio-image.png" class="pull-left" alt="Christopher in Yellowstone" style="margin-right:10px">
            <p> 
            I have a BS in Philosophy, from the University of Utah.</p>
             <p>I am happily married, I met my wife on a blind-date over 30 years ago. We have two sons-both of whom attend UC Berkeley and play Rugby for the Bears. Go Bears!</p>
             <p>My favorite quote is: "It's only impossible if you stop and think about it!"â€”the Pirate Captain, from the movie:"The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists." </p>
              <p>I have a lot of interests and hobbies. My hobbies include (but are not limited to):</p>
              <ul>
              <li title="I pulled my kids from school and sailed to Mexico with my family for 6 months-it was awesome!">Sailing</li>
              <li title="I have a friend who owns a distillery, Sutherland Distilling, in Livermore. I bought 4,000 lbs of wild rice and together we made whiskey! I have made beer since highschool and my sons and I would make mead, which we would then drink from horns while watching the TV series Vikings.">Making Beer, Wine (Mead) and Whiskey</li>
              <li title="It all started when my father and I attempted to blacksmith something for my mom, neither of us had a clue as to what were doing. I then took a blacksmithing class, from my friend, Paul Quyle. After I made my first metal object, I realized it would be around a lot longer than me, I was hooked!">Blacksmithing</li>
              <li title="The first thing I do when I become interested in something is to buy books. I have books on every subject that has ever held my interest, from Artistic Blacksmithing to Zoology">Reading</li>
              <li title="My wife is a graphic designer, I bought her an old hand-press for her birthday. Since she was pregnant with our first son, she could not be near the solvents associated with printing. I learned how to print and set type and then taught her. I eventually worked at Arion Press, in San Francisco, and helped them print a lectern Bible. The type for the Bible was cast from a typecaster driven by a MacIntosh computer, the program was written in Basic.">Letter Press Printing</li>
              <li title="I have been fortunate to have, so far, visited 46 countries and 35 of our fifty somewhat United States. I have: swam with whale sharks in Mexico, been on safari in Africa, toured the Greek Islands by boat, and played Polo on elephants in Northern India. My wife, our dog and I are on a current quest to visit every National Park and to have visited all 50 states.">Adventure</li>
